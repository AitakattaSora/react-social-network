# React Social Network

This is a project for React learning purposes.

## Scripts

To start client (React):
```bash
yarn start
```

To start server:

```
json-server --watch db.json -p 3004
```

I use [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) as server for API calls.
To install it:
```
npm -g install json-server
```
